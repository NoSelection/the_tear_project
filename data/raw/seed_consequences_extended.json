    "consequence_harmful": "She bought the lingerie. She went to the gym. She performed a version of herself she thought was wanted, but the distance remained. The rejection, when it came, wasn't spoken; it was a turned back, a heavy sigh. She learned that her desire was a burden, something to be managed or suppressed. She stopped initiating. She stopped touching. Eventually, she stopped wanting. It was safer to be numb than to be hungry.",
    "response_gentle": "That feeling of disconnect can be so lonely, especially when it's physical. What comes up for you when you notice the distance?",
    "consequence_gentle": "She cried, unexpected and hot. 'I feel ugly,' she whispered. 'I feel like I'm invisible to the one person who's supposed to see me.' Saying it broke the shame. She didn't fix the relationship that night, but she stopped fixing herself. She approached him later, not with seduction, but with honesty. 'I miss you,' she said. 'I miss us.'

She found a 'perfect' partner\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstable, distant, needing nothing. She withered in the lack of connection. She had traded chaos for a vacuum, thinking it was health. She was safe, and she was completely alone.",
    "response_gentle": "That sounds incredibly draining. What does it feel like when you're in that 'fixer' role?",
    "consequence_gentle": "She realized it felt like worth. 'If I can save them, then I matter.' The realization hit her hard. She wasn't attracting broken people; she was seeking validation through utility. She started setting boundaries, not walls. When she met someone new who was struggling, she offered support, not a solution. It felt uncomfortable. It also felt free.",

She stayed in the group, smiling, offering pieces of herself to people who had already decided she was separate. She became a ghost in her own circle, present but unseen, haunting a friendship that had already moved on.",

    "consequence_gentle": "'I thought I was boring. I thought they were finally tired of me.' She let herself feel the sting of it. Then she asked one of them. 'I saw the chat. It hurt.'

She withdrew further, confirming her own hypothesis. By the time someone finally did reach out\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmonths later, asking if she was okay\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe was too far gone to answer. She had proven herself right, at the cost of her own heart.",
    "response_gentle": "That silence can get so loud. What are you afraid you'd find out if you stopped reaching out?",
    "consequence_gentle": "'That I'm easily forgotten.' The words hung in the air. She realized her reaching out wasn't just connection; it was anxiety. She decided to try a different experiment. She reached out to one person\u00e2\u20ac\u201dher closest friend\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand said, 'I'm feeling a bit insecure about our friendship lately. I feel like I'm always chasing.'

She carried that story into her next relationship, waiting for the other shoe to drop, waiting to be replaced. She never felt chosen, only temporarily tolerated. The engagement ring wasn't on her finger, but its weight was on her life.",

    "consequence_gentle": "'It feels like they won,' she said. 'Like their bad behavior was rewarded and I was punished.' She let herself rage. She let herself cry over the unfairness of the universe. And in acknowledging the unfairness, she stopped looking for the flaw in herself. It wasn't that she wasn't enough.

The team's trust fractured. They did what they were told, but they stopped doing what mattered\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcollaborating, sharing, caring. She sat in her office, successful and solitary, wondering why the view from the top looked so much like a wall.",
    "response_gentle": "That's such a tricky transition\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshifting the dynamic without losing the connection. What are you most afraid of losing?",
    "consequence_gentle": "'I'm afraid they'll think I think I'm better than them.' She called a meeting. Not a 'boss' meeting, but a team meeting. 'This is weird for me,' she admitted.

    "consequence_gentle": "'It sounds like 'You're too old to start over.' It sounds like 'You only know how to do this one thing.'' He challenged the voice. He took a course on Saturday mornings.

When a junior employee came to her, tearing up, she said, 'Pull yourself together.' She heard her own voice and hated it, but she didn't know how to be anything else anymore.",

    "consequence_gentle": "She tracked it. It wasn't the work. It was the way her manager spoke to her\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddismissive, cutting. The tears were anger with nowhere to go.
