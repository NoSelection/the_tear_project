'I kept wondering what else had happened to them today. What yesterday was like. Who else had bumped into them and never looked back.' He sat with it.

The next morning, he stopped. 'I'm David,' he said. 'I know we see each other every day, but I realized I never introduced myself.' The janitor smiled \u00e2\u20ac\u201d surprised, then warm. 'Miguel.' They talked for five minutes. Then ten. Then it became a ritual. When Miguel retired, David spoke at the gathering.

At sixteen, when her grandmother died, she didn't cry at the funeral. She didn't know how to. Her father watched her and felt proud of how strong she was.",

'Hey \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I think I saw you today and panicked. I'm sorry. Coffee sometime?' The reply came in minutes: 'I thought that was you. I almost hid too. Yes to coffee.' They met that weekend.
